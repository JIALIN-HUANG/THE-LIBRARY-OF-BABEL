            Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the
            catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few
            leagues from the hexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw
            me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve
            in the wind generated by the fall, which is infinite. I say that the Library is unending. The idealists
            argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of
            space.

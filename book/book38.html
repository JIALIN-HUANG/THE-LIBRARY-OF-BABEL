            Epidemics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations which inevitably degenerate into banditry, have decimated the
            population. I believe I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the years. Perhaps my old age
            and fearfulness deceive me, but I suspect that the human species - the unique species - is about to be
            extinguished, but the Library will endure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped
            with precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.

            We also know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf in some
            hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book which is the formula and perfect compendium of all the rest:
            some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god. In the language of this zone vestiges of
            this remote functionary's cult still persist. Many wandered in search of Him.

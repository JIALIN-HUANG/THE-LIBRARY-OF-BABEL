            great deal was said about the Vindications: books of apology and prophecy which vindicated for all time the
            acts of every man in the universe and retained prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy
            abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of finding
            their Vindication.

            They speak (I know) of the "feverish Library whose chance volumes are constantly in danger of changing into
            others and affirm, negate and confuse everything like a delirious divinity." These words, which not only
            denounce the disorder but exemplify it as well, notoriously prove their authors' abominable taste and
            desperate ignorance. In truth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the
            twenty-five orthographical symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe
            that the best volume of the many hexagons under my administration is entitled The Combed Thunderclap and
            another The Plaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlo.

            The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and
            perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between,
            surrounded by very low railings. From any of the hexagons one can see,
            interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is
            invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except
            two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that
            of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which
            opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and
            right of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may sleep
            standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities.

            For four centuries now men have exhausted the hexagons... There are official searchers, inquisitors. I have
            seen them in the performance of their function: they always arrive extremely tired from their journeys; they
            speak of a broken stairway which almost killed them; they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs;
            sometimes they pick up the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words. Obviously, no one
            expects to discover anything.

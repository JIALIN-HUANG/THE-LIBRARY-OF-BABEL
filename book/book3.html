            Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote
            distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all
            appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it
            were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces
            represent and promise the infinite ... Light is provided by some spherical fruit
            which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each
            hexagon. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.

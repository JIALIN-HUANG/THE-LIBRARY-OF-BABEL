            This wordy and useless epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of one of the
            innumerable hexagons - and its refutation as well. (An n number of possible languages use the same
            vocabulary; in some of them, the symbol library allows the correct definition a ubiquitous and lasting
            system of hexagonal galleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and these seven words which
            define it have another value. You who read me, are You sure of understanding my language?)

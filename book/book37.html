            The methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men. The certitude that everything has
            been written negates us or turns us into phantoms. I know of districts in which the young men prostrate
            themselves before books and kiss their pages in a barbarous manner, but they do not know how to decipher a
            single letter.

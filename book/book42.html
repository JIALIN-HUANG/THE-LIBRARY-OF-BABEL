            Most of the books in the Library don't seem to make any sense. The Library's inhabitants used to have a lot
            of theories about why this is – maybe the books are written in another language, they speculated, or maybe
            in code. Five hundred years ago, though, a man of genius was able to figure out the Library's secret.
            Because no two books in the Library are identical, he argued, the Library is "total" – in other words, it
            contains every single possible combination of the 25 written characters. This means that in all those
            collections of 410 pages, the Library contains everything that can be expressed in writing, in every
            possible language.

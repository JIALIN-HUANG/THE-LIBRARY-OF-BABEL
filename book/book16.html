            Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon 2 came upon a book as confusing as the others, but
            which had nearly two pages of homogeneous lines. He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the
            lines were written in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the language was
            established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections.

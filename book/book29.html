            One: the Library is so enormous that any reduction of human origin is infinitesimal. The other: every copy
            is unique, irreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred thousand
            imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a letter or a comma. Counter to general opinion, I venture
            to suppose that the consequences of the Purifiers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these
            fanatics produced.

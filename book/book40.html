            Those who imagine it to be without limit forget that the possible number of books does have such a limit. I
            venture to suggest this solution to the ancient problem: The Library is unlimited and cyclical. If an
            eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries he would see that the same volumes were
            repeated in the same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order). My solitude is gladdened

            These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or allegorical
            manner; such a justification is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already figures in the Library. I cannot combine
            some characters which the divine Library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret tongues do not
            contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a syllable which is not filled with tenderness and fear,
            which is not, in one of these languages, the powerful name of a god. To speak is to fall into tautology.
